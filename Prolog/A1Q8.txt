1. ? magic(Hermione).
	
	Output: Hermione = dobby
		Hermione = dobby
		Hermione = hermione
		Hermione = mcGonagall
		Hermione = rita_skeeter

	Steps: The program will go through every rule in the set. 
	       Since Hermione is title cased, it will be instatiated with each element within the facts.
	       First it looks at magic(Hermione):- house_elf(Hermione). The program will unify Hermione = dobby, since there is house_elf(dobby).
	       Second it looks at magic(Hermione):- wizard(Hermione). The program will unify Hermione = dobby again, since there is wizard(dobby).
	       Third it look at magic(Hermione):- witch(Hermione). The program will unify Hermione = hermione, Hermione = mcGonagall, and Hermione = rita_skeeter, sequentially.
	       Each unification is shown in the output above.
	       	

2. ? magic(hermione).
	
	Output: true
	
	Steps: The program will look for a fact that will make magic(hermione) true.
	       First it looks at magic(hermione):- house_elf(hermione). Since house_elf(hermione) does not exist, it will return false.
	       Second it looks at magic(hermione):- wizard(hermione). Since wizard(hermione) does not exist, it returns false.
	       Third it looks at magic(hermione):- witch(hermione). Since the program found witch(hermione) it returns true. Shown in the output above.
